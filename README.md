# mvvm_kotlin_androidstudio_3.3.2
MVVM Template architecture to use with Android Studio 3.3.2, written in Kotlin

This template supports API 15 and above and uses the following technologies:

  - Multidex support: https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex.html
  - Lifecycle support: https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle.html
  - Data Binding: https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html
  - Dagger 2: https://google.github.io/dagger
  - Retrofit: http://square.github.io/retrofit
  - OkHttp: http://square.github.io/okhttp
  - RxJava: https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava
  - RxAndroid: https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid

The runtime data should be saved in the RuntimeData class (in the package 'model').

The communication wth the backend is using Retrofit; the endpoints are defined in the NetworkingAPI'
interface (package 'service.api') and their implementation go in the NetworkingService class
(package 'service').
The App already managed two different backend: the development/testing one the production. The roots
of the url of the endpoints has to be defined in the 'build.config' file under the key 'restBaseUrl'.

To create a new project from this template, proceed as following:

1. Download or clone the project
2. On the 'Project' view create the new package name for your App
3. Move the packages from the package 'com.template.mvvmtemplate' to your new package (there will be some warning, but you can proceed)
4. Delete the original package 'com.template.mvvmtemplate'
5. Open the AndroidManifest.xml file and update the package name with the new package name
6. Open the 'activity_main.xml' layout file and update the package in the <variable>
7. Rebuild the full project and update the package where the refactoring process hasn't updated to the new package name.
8. Rename the class 'MVVMTemplateApplication' to the name of your choice and apply the change to all the classes references it
9. Finally update the 'applicationId' in the build.config file

Optionals
In case you use unit testing (and you should !), create the new package for test and androidTest.

Note:
The runtime errors are managed by the  ErrorManagement class in the 'error' package: you should add
the code to log the error on a remote service (like Crashlytics); at the moment there is a comment
where the code should be located. In the current implementation the errors generated by the debug
version are displayed as a toast.
